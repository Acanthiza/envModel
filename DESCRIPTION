Title: Model Clusters as a Function of Environmental Variables
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Prepare data and run models (currently only random forest) to
    predict group membership as a function of environmental variables. Quick
    random forest runs over many clusterings outputting only confusion matrix
    then choose an area of clustering space for a 'good' model and run
    (parallel) random forest, iteratively adding trees until results stabilise
    between iterations.
